# README

All slides were created using Posit's Quarto. You can find the relevant files in this repository. Note, however that you will not be able to render the slides. You would need your own PowerPoint template. I have also not included relevant resources like pictures I use in the slides, since I do not hold their copyright.

I also include the Quarto document used for creating the mini syllabus. This will also not render, as I have not included the Quarto extension files (sorry!). However, these are easy to retrieve, as I have written the extension myself. Just follow the introductions I give in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tisprang/quarto_syllabus).
